== README Bookshelf

This is a project on my own mixing two of my passions, Books and Development using Ruby on Rails.
The idea is to create a social network for bookworms, in which one can keep track of books read, to be read, and categorize them by bookshelves. In the future, boting, recommendations, comments will be available.

I have used Heroku to deploy this project, and it can be find on the following link:

This is a work on progress...
